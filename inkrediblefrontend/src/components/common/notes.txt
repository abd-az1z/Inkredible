# Navbar.jsx
This Navbar component in React creates a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices and a horizontal menu for larger screens. It uses useState to toggle the visibility of the side menu and framer-motion for smooth animations when opening or closing the menu. The side menu includes links for categories like Men, Women, Kids, Unisex, and Sale, while the larger screen version displays these links in a horizontal layout. The navbar also includes icons for search, user, and shopping cart, with a logo prominently displayed in the center.

# Footer.jsx
This Footer component in React displays collapsible sections for mobile view and static sections for desktop view. The collapsible sections include “Account,” “Company,” “Get Help,” and “Connect,” and they expand or collapse when clicked. The desktop view shows these sections in a grid format. It also includes an email signup form and a bottom section with links to privacy policies and terms of service. The toggleSection function manages the state to show or hide sections on mobile.

# Reviews.jsx
This Reviews component in React displays a carousel of customer reviews, where each review includes a rating, text, reviewer name, product name, and an image. The component uses useState to track the current review being displayed, with navigation handled by left and right arrow buttons to switch between reviews. It dynamically renders star ratings based on the current review’s rating and presents the content responsively, showing both text and images. The layout adjusts for smaller and larger screens, and each review is shown with an image on the right and text on the left.

# Tagline.jsx
This Tagline component in React displays an animated rotation of taglines using useState and useEffect for managing the current tagline, and framer-motion for smooth transitions. The taglines change automatically every 3 seconds, and each tagline fades in and out with a slide effect using motion animation. The component is responsive, with the taglines centered and properly spaced for both mobile and larger screen sizes.
